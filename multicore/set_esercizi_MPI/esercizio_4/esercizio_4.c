/*
the method discussed in the previous exercise is known as iterative stencil computation. it is widely used in
practice to solve partial differential equaitons, in computational fluid dynamics, and in many other fields.

Adapt the previous exercise to work on 3D matrix instead, where each point is computed as the sum of its 6
neighbors as shown in the following picture
